	Bah, I hate pointers some days.

2009-06-30  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Trying to flesh out the add function some more, but this commit doesn't build as apparently switches have to have integers now.  This takes half of the fun out of C if you can't use crazy function pointers everywhere!  Where's the sport in readable code?

2009-06-30  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Oh, the signal is 'add' not 'added'.  How I love to have random strings without checking, all the elegance of Python.

2009-06-19  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Fleshing out the insertion function.  Let's get some menus.

2009-06-19  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

2009-06-12  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	A quickly little object to put itself on DBus.

2009-06-12  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Brining in the client side of the API

2009-06-12  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Actually the client is the indicator.  Silly to have one binary be both client and server, heh.

2009-06-12  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding a DBus interface for the status specific stuff

2009-06-12  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding in a proxy to start gettin' us some Pidgin

2009-06-11  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Oops, what a mess up. But this sure makes things unhappy.  Nasty to debug segfault.

2009-06-11  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Okay, let's use these providers.  We're 733t now.

2009-06-11  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Starting to connect things together.  Let's get some Pidgin in there.

2009-06-11  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Now we're setting the status provider functions of the StatusProvider interface.

2009-06-11  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

2009-06-11  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding in a good ol' signal handler and even emits this puppy.  Whew.

2009-06-11  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Some public funtions and now they can be subclassed

2009-06-11  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Don't need a private or dispose or finalize.  This class is more of an interface.

2009-06-11  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Moving the enum into the provider object and changing the name everywhere.

2009-06-11  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

2009-06-10  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Connecting in a callback.

2009-06-10  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Building the menuitems

2009-06-10  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Using the defines and strings that were in our patches to FUSA.  I wrote the code, so it is like other things © Canonical so there is no issue there.  There is other code in FUSA that is not.

2009-06-10  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Making sure to clean up the generated service files.  Whew.  Pass distcheck.

2009-06-10  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding in the DBus services directory with localinstall support

2009-06-10  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

2009-06-09  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Bringing up a dbusmenu item.

2009-06-09  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding more dependencies and cflags and stuff to make the builds of the services more complete

2009-06-09  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Oh, stealing the methods used in PolicyKit for building these.  I dislike calling sed directly, but the results are fantastic.

2009-06-09  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding in a bunch of service files.  We're hip now.

2009-06-09  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Now we're building services.  Snazy.
