	Adding an attention parameter to the server and initing it.

2009-09-04  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

2009-09-04  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Reshuffle.  Now the creation of an indicator makes for a im-menu-item without looking at type and subtype at all.  We'll have a bunch more now.

2009-08-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	The documentation clearly states that you don't need these if the client supports introspection.  I thought I was being old school by still putting them in.  But, THE DOCUMENTATION LIES, you need to add the signals no matter what.

	Now parsing the directory on start up.  Getting this whole thing started up.

2009-08-20  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Writing the fairly extensive and complex check function.  But, if that's the way it needs to be, I guess it needs to be that way.

2009-08-20  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	We're taking ownership of that variable as well

2009-08-20  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>
